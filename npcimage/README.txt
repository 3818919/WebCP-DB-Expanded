##NPC Graphic Images
#Include NPC graphics in this folder.
#The Database prefers the items saved in '.gif' format
#Please save images as their egf file ID
#The preferred image is NPC animation frame 1 (Ancient Wraith is invisible-Use Wraith instead)
#If no graphics are given, the web image reference will be ignored (this is normal)
