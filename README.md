# WebCP-Full Database
 EOSERV-WebCP panel with Expanded Database Menu

 This project is an expanded branch of WebCP originally published by Sausage(Julian Smythe).
 
 To use WebCP, setup begins in the config.php file (do not use your previous config.php as a quick patch in).
 To display database items properly, please use the Pub Import tool to convert .ini files into .epf format and store these in your pub directory (epf is not required to be running on your game server).
 Images can be shown for items, NPCs, and spells follwing the instructions given in the image directories.
 
 It is recommended if replacing your original WebCP that you make a backup of it and install this project into a clean directory rather than overwriting the existing one.
